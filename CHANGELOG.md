- Support added for Adafruit Metro RP2350 board. See README for more info. No RISCV support yet.
- Switched to SD card driver pico_fatfs from https://github.com/elehobica/pico_fatfs. This is required for the Adafruit Metro RP2350. Thanks to [elehobica](https://github.com/elehobica/pico_fatfs) for helping making it work for the Pimoroni Pico DV Demo board.
- Besides FAT32, SD cards can now also be formatted as exFAT.
- Nes controller PIO code updated by [@ManCloud](https://github.com/ManCloud). This fixes the NES controller issues on the Waveshare RP2040 - PiZero board. [#8](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico_shared/issues/8)
- Board configs are moved to pico_shared.

## 01/01/2025

- Enabe fastscrolling in the menu, by holding up/down/left/right for 500 milliseconds, repeat delay is 40 milliseconds.
- bld.sh mow uses the amount of cores available on the system to speed up the build process.
- Temporary Rollback NesPad code for the WaveShare RP2040-PiZero only. Other configurations are not affected.
- Update time functions to return milliseconds and use uint64_t to return microseconds.

## 22/12/2024

- The menu now uses the entire screen resolution of 320x240 pixels. This makes a 40x30 char screen with 8x8 font possible instead of 32x29. This also fixes the menu not displaying correctly on Risc-v builds because of a not implemented assembly rendering routine in Risc-v.
- Updated NESPAD to have CLK idle HIGH instead of idle LOW. Thanks to [ManCloud](https://github.com/ManCloud). 
- Other minor changes.
